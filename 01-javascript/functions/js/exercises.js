// # Exercises: Functions
//
// ## The Fortune Teller
//
// Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?
//
// Write a function named tellFortune that:
// - takes 4 arguments: number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.
// - outputs your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."
// - Call that function 3 times with 3 different values for the arguments.

const tellFortune =function (fatherName, numChildren,address, jobTitle){
    console.log(`You will be a ${jobTitle} in ${address}, and married to ${fatherName} with ${numChildren} kids.`)
  }
tellFortune(fatherName, numChildren,address, jobTitle);

// ## The Puppy Age Calculator
//
// You know how old your dog is in human years, but what about dog years? Calculate it!
//
// Write a function named calculateDogAge that:
// - takes 1 argument: your puppy's age.
// - calculates your dog's age based on the conversion rate of 1 human year to 7 dog years.
// - outputs the result to the screen like so: "Your doggie is NN years old in dog years!"
// - Call the function three times with different sets of values.
// - Bonus: Add an additional argument to the function that takes the conversion rate of human to dog years.
//
const calculateDogAge = function(puppyAge){
      const yourDogAge = puppyAge *7;
      const doggiAge =`Your doggie is ${yourDogAge} years old in dog years!`;
      console.log(doggiAge);

}



// ## The Lifetime Supply Calculator
//
// Ever wonder how much a "lifetime supply" of your favorite snack is? Wonder no more!
//
// Write a function named calculateSupply that:
// - takes 2 arguments: age, amount per day.
// - calculates the amount consumed for rest of the life (based on a constant max age).
// - outputs the result to the screen like so: "You will need NN to last you until the ripe old age of X"
// - Call that function three times, passing in different values each time.
// - Bonus: Accept floating point values for amount per day, and round the result to a round number.
//
// ## The Geometrizer
//
// Create 2 functions that calculate properties of a circle.
//
// Create a function called calcCircumfrence:
//
// - Pass the radius to the function.
// - Calculate the circumference based on the radius, and output "The circumference is NN".
//
// Create a function called calcArea:
//
// - Pass the radius to the function.
// - Calculate the area based on the radius, and output "The area is NN".
//
// ## The Temperature Converter
//
// It's hot out! Let's make a converter.
//
// Create a function called celsiusToFahrenheit:
// - Store a celsius temperature into a variable.
// - Convert it to fahrenheit and output "NN째C is NN째F".
// - Create a function called fahrenheitToCelsius:
//
// Now store a fahrenheit temperature into a variable.
// - Convert it to celsius and output "NN째F is NN째C."
